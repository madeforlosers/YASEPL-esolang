to lyxal (the first person that starred this) thank you i love your work and you inspired me to make yasepl + other esolangs

# YASEPL-esolang (version 91824-1416)
yasepl is a stupid esolang i made

note i started development on this months before i uploaded it to github

if you want to load a file put in the filename in the arguments like `node yasepl.js [filename]`. if there is no argument it just loads `test.aepl`

view the docs in the `docs.md` file. ill make it a wiki soon

## update timeline since uploaded to github:
